SECURE YOUR ACCOUNT

Your account does not have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled.

We strongly recommend enabling 2FA to protect your account from unauthorized
access. Even if someone obtains your password, they won't be able to log in
without your second factor.

Set up 2FA now:

{setup_url}

WHY ENABLE 2FA?

- Protects against password breaches
- Prevents unauthorized access even if your password is compromised
- Adds an extra layer of security to your account
- Takes only a few minutes to set up
