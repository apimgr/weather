Subject: Secure Your Account - {app_name}
---
Hello,

We noticed that you haven't enabled two-factor authentication (2FA) on your {app_name} account yet.

**Why Enable 2FA?**

Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your account. Even if someone gets your password, they won't be able to access your account without the second factor.

**Set Up 2FA Now:**

You can enable 2FA in your account settings:
{setup_url}

**Options Available:**
- Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) - works with apps like Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password
- Recovery codes for emergency access

**Don't Want Reminders?**

If you prefer not to enable 2FA, you can permanently dismiss these reminders in your security settings:
{dismiss_url}

Thank you for helping keep {app_name} secure!
