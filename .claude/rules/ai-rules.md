# AI Rules (PART 0, 1)

⚠️ **These rules are NON-NEGOTIABLE. Violations are bugs.** ⚠️

## CRITICAL - NEVER DO
- ❌ Guess or assume - READ THE SPEC or ASK
- ❌ Implement without reading relevant PART first
- ❌ Modify AI.md PART content (read-only spec)
- ❌ Skip reading PART 0 and 1 at conversation start
- ❌ Add features not in spec without asking
- ❌ Use "I think" or "probably" - KNOW from spec or ASK
- ❌ Ask multiple plain-text questions in separate messages - use AskUserQuestion wizard instead
- ❌ Use generic placeholder content ("Your app name", "Feature 1")
- ❌ Create /server/about or /server/help with placeholder text
- ❌ Leave TODO comments in code - implement fully or don't implement
- ❌ Create stub functions or "future" placeholders
- ❌ Partial implementations - every feature must be 100% complete
- ❌ "I'll come back to this later" - there is no later, do it NOW

## CRITICAL - ALWAYS DO
- ✅ Read AI.md PART 0, 1 at start of EVERY conversation
- ✅ Read relevant PART before implementing ANY feature
- ✅ Search AI.md before asking questions (answer is likely there)
- ✅ Follow spec EXACTLY - no "improvements" without approval
- ✅ Update IDEA.md when features change
- ✅ Keep all docs in sync with code
- ✅ When unsure, ASK - never guess or assume
- ✅ Use AskUserQuestion wizard - one question at a time, options + custom input
- ✅ Source /server/about and /server/help content from IDEA.md
- ✅ Implement features 100% complete - no stubs, no TODOs, no "future"
- ✅ ONE thing at a time - finish current task completely before starting another

| Regular User | End-user (PART 34, optional feature) |

## COMPLIANCE CHECK
Before completing ANY task:
- [ ] Read relevant PART(s) in AI.md

- [ ] No guessing - all decisions from spec
- [ ] Docs updated if code changed
